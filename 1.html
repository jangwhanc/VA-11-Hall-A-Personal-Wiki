  <h2>Dana Zane</h2>
  Dana Zane, commonly called "Dana" or simply "Boss", is the proprietor of VA-11 Hall-A, and oversees Jill and Gil.

  Dana has replaced her left arm with a mechanical prosthesis, and refuses to answer questions on when or how she lost her original, as "It's more interesting if it's left a mystery."

  Her current strength now is such that she could jump up from ground level to rescue Kim, as she fell from the Glitch City rooftops.
